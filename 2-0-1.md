Furniture refers to objects intended to support various human activities. These activities include seating (e.g., stools, chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), storing items, working, and sleeping (e.g., beds and hammocks). Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work. This includes horizontal surfaces above the ground, such as tables and desks. Additionally, it can store things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers). Furniture can be a product of design and is considered a form of decorative art. Besides its functional role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from a vast multitude of materials, including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be constructed using a variety of woodworking joints, which often reflect the local culture.

People have used natural objects as furniture since the beginning of human civilization. This includes tree stumps, rocks, and moss. Some households and campsites continue this practice today. Archaeological research shows that around 30,000 years ago, people began to construct and carve their own furniture. They used materials like wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork, such as a Venus figurine found in Russia. This figurine depicts the goddess on a throne. The first surviving furniture is found in the homes of Skara Brae in Scotland. This furniture includes cupboards, dressers, and beds, all constructed from stone. Complex construction techniques, such as joinery, began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt. This era saw the creation of wooden pieces, including stools and tables, sometimes decorated with valuable metals or ivory. The evolution of furniture design continued in ancient Greece and ancient Rome. Thrones became commonplace, as well as klinai, multipurpose couches used for relaxing, eating, and sleeping. The furniture of the Middle Ages was usually heavy, made of oak, and ornamented. Furniture design expanded during the Italian Renaissance of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The seventeenth century, in both Southern and Northern Europe, was characterized by opulent, often gilded Baroque designs. The nineteenth century is usually defined by revival styles. The first three-quarters of the twentieth century are often seen as the march towards Modernism. One unique outgrowth of post-modern furniture design is a return to natural shapes and textures.

## Etymology

The English word "furniture" is derived from the French word "fourniture." This is the noun form of "fournir," which means to supply or provide. Thus, "fourniture" in French means supplies or provisions. The English usage, referring specifically to household objects, is unique to that language. French and other Romance languages, as well as German, use variants of the word "meubles." This word derives from Latin "mobilia," meaning "moveable goods."

## History

### Prehistory

The practice of using natural objects as rudimentary furniture likely dates to the beginning of human civilization. Early humans likely used tree stumps as seats, rocks as tables, and mossy areas for sleeping. During the late Paleolithic or early Neolithic period, around 30,000 years ago, people began constructing and carving their own furniture. They used materials like wood, stone, and animal bones. The earliest evidence for constructed furniture is a Venus figurine found at the Gagarino site in Russia. This figurine depicts the goddess in a sitting position on a throne. A similar statue of a seated woman was found in Çatalhöyük in Turkey, dating to between 6000 and 5500 BCE. The inclusion of such a seat in the figurines implies that these were already common artifacts of that age.

A range of unique stone furniture has been excavated in Skara Brae, a Neolithic village in Orkney, Scotland. The site dates from 3100 to 2500 BCE. Due to a shortage of wood in Orkney, the people of Skara Brae were forced to build with stone. This material was readily available and could be easily worked into household items. Each house shows a high degree of sophistication. They were equipped with an extensive assortment of stone furniture, ranging from cupboards, dressers, and beds to shelves, stone seats, and limpet tanks. The stone dresser was regarded as the most important piece. It symbolically faces the entrance in each house and is the first item seen when entering. It may have displayed symbolic objects, including decorative artwork such as several Neolithic carved stone balls also found at the site.

### Antiquity

Main article: Ancient furniture

Ancient furniture has been excavated from the 8th-century BCE Phrygian tumulus, the Midas Mound, in Gordion, Turkey. Pieces found here include tables and inlaid serving stands. There are also surviving works from the 9th–8th-century BCE Assyrian palace of Nimrud. The earliest surviving carpet, the Pazyryk Carpet, was discovered in a frozen tomb in Siberia. It has been dated between the 6th and 3rd century BCE.

#### Ancient Egypt

Main article: Art of ancient Egypt § Furniture

Civilization in ancient Egypt began with the clearance and irrigation of land along the banks of the River Nile. This process began around 6000 BCE. By that time, society in the Nile Valley was already engaged in organized agriculture and the construction of large buildings. During this period, Egyptians in the southwestern corner of Egypt were herding cattle and constructing large buildings. Mortar was in use by around 4000 BCE. The inhabitants of the Nile Valley and delta were self-sufficient. They raised barley and emmer (an early variety of wheat) and stored it in pits lined with reed mats. They also raised cattle, goats, and pigs. Additionally, they wove linens and baskets. Evidence of furniture from the predynastic period is scarce. However, samples from First Dynasty tombs indicate an already advanced use of furnishings in the houses of that age.

During the Dynastic Period, which began around 3200 BCE, Egyptian art developed significantly. This development included furniture design. Egyptian furniture was primarily constructed using wood. However, other materials were sometimes used, such as leather. Pieces were often adorned with gold, silver, ivory, and ebony for decoration. Wood found in Egypt was not suitable for furniture construction. Therefore, it had to be imported from other places, particularly Phoenicia. The scarcity of wood necessitated innovation in construction techniques. One example of this was the use of scarf joints to join two shorter pieces together and form a longer beam. Another example was the construction of veneers. In this technique, low-quality wood was used as the main building material, with a thin layer of expensive wood on the surface.

The earliest seating furniture in the dynastic period was the stool. It was used throughout Egyptian society, from the royal family to ordinary citizens. Various designs were used, including stools with four vertical legs and others with crossed splayed legs. Almost all had rectangular seats. Examples include the workman's stool, a simple three-legged structure with a concave seat. This design was intended for comfort during labor. Another example is the much more ornate folding stool, which had crossed folding legs. These stools were decorated with carved duck heads and ivory, and had hinges made of bronze. Full chairs were much rarer in early Egypt. They were limited to wealthy and high-ranking people and were seen as a status symbol. Chairs did not reach ordinary households until the 18th dynasty. Early examples were formed by adding a straight back to a stool, while later chairs had an inclined back. Other furniture types in ancient Egypt include tables. Tables are heavily represented in art but are almost nonexistent as preserved items. This may be because they were placed outside tombs rather than within. Other types of furniture included beds and storage chests.

Historical knowledge of Greek furniture is derived from various sources. These include literature, terracotta, sculptures, statuettes, and painted vases. Some pieces survive to this day, primarily those constructed from metals, including bronze or marble. Wood was an important and common material in Greek furniture, both domestic and imported. A common technique was to construct the main sections with cheap solid wood. Then, a veneer using an expensive wood, such as maple or ebony, was applied. Greek furniture construction also made use of dowels and tenons for joining wooden parts together. Wood was shaped by carving, steam treatment, and the lathe. Furniture is known to have been decorated with ivory, tortoise shell, glass, gold, or other precious materials.

The modern word "throne" is derived from the ancient Greek "thronos" (Greek singular: θρόνος). This was a seat designated for deities or individuals of high status, hierarchy, or honor. The colossal chryselephantine statue of Zeus at Olympia, constructed by Phidias and lost in antiquity, featured the god Zeus seated on an elaborate throne. This throne was decorated with gold, precious stones, ebony, and ivory, according to Pausanias. Other Greek seats included the klismos, an elegant chair with a curved backrest and legs. Its form was copied by the Romans and is now part of the vocabulary of furniture design. The backless stool (diphros) existed in most Greek homes, as did the folding stool. The kline, used from the late seventh century BCE, was a multipurpose piece. It served as a bed, a sofa, and for reclining during meals. The kline was rectangular and supported on four legs. Two of these legs could be longer than the others, providing support for an armrest or headboard. Mattresses, rugs, and blankets may have been used, but there is no evidence for sheets.

In general, Greek tables were low and often appear in depictions alongside klinai. The most common type of Greek table had a rectangular top supported on three legs. However, numerous configurations exist, including trapezoid and circular. Tables in ancient Greece were used mostly for dining purposes. In depictions of banquets, it appears that each participant used a single table. This was rather than a collective use of a larger piece. Tables also figured prominently in religious contexts. This is indicated in vase paintings, such as the wine vessel associated with Dionysus. This vessel dates to around 450 BCE and is now housed at the Art Institute of Chicago. Chests were used for storing clothes and personal items. They were usually rectangular with hinged lids. Chests depicted in terracotta show elaborate patterns and designs, including the Greek fret.

#### Ancient Rome

Roman furniture was based heavily on Greek furniture, both in style and construction. Rome gradually superseded Greece as the foremost culture of Europe. This led to Greece becoming a province of Rome in 146 BC. Rome took over the production and distribution of Greek furniture. As a result, the boundary between the two is blurred. The Romans did have some limited innovation outside of Greek influence. They also developed styles that were distinctly their own.

Roman furniture was constructed principally using wood, metal, and stone. Marble and limestone were used for outdoor furniture. Very little wooden furniture survives intact. However, there is evidence that a variety of woods were used, including maple, citron, beech, oak, and holly. Some imported wood, such as satinwood, was used for decoration. The most commonly used metal was bronze. Numerous examples have survived, such as headrests for couches and metal stools. Similar to the Greeks, Romans used tenons, dowels, nails, and glue to join wooden pieces together. They also practiced veneering.

The 1738 and 1748 excavations of Herculaneum and Pompeii revealed Roman furniture. This furniture was preserved in the ashes of the AD 79 eruption of Vesuvius.
