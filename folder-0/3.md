> you know how when  you have language, you can easily understand how to use it when someone speaks in it from a basic level to describe the obvious, and go up into describing abstractions build from the wordplay of fundamental grammar and metaphorisms? is there a word for that?

Yes, the concept you're describing relates to "linguistic competence." This term refers to a speaker's implicit knowledge of their language's structure, including grammar, vocabulary, and the ability to understand and produce both literal and abstract meanings. Additionally, "pragmatics" refers to the use of language in context, including understanding implied meanings and metaphors.

> what is the meanings-based theory/history of "pragmatic" and "linguistic"?

**Pragmatics** and **linguistics** are both fields within the study of language, but they focus on different aspects.

### Pragmatics
- **Definition**: Pragmatics is the branch of linguistics that studies how context influences the interpretation of meaning. It examines how language is used in real situations and how meaning is constructed beyond the literal interpretation of words.
- **History**: The term "pragmatics" was coined in the 1930s by philosopher Charles Morris. It gained prominence in the 1970s with the work of linguists like H.P. Grice, who introduced the concept of implicature, and J.L. Austin, who developed speech act theory. Pragmatics explores how speakers convey meaning through context, intention, and social norms.

### Linguistics
- **Definition**: Linguistics is the scientific study of language, encompassing its structure (syntax, morphology, phonetics, and phonology), meaning (semantics), and use (pragmatics). It seeks to understand how languages function and how they are acquired and processed.
- **History**: Linguistics has ancient roots, with early contributions from philosophers like Panini in Sanskrit grammar and later developments in the 19th century with the rise of historical linguistics. The 20th century saw the emergence of structuralism (Ferdinand de Saussure) and generative grammar (Noam Chomsky), which focused on the underlying rules and structures of language.

In summary, pragmatics focuses on context and meaning in use, while linguistics encompasses the broader study of language structure and function.
