# From adoption to continuance: Stablecoins in cross-border remittances and the role of digital and financial literacy

## Highlights

- Digital and financial literacy boost stablecoin adoption for remittances.  
- Younger, educated users lead in stablecoin remittance transactions.  
- User satisfaction and perceived usefulness drive stablecoin continuance.  
- The synergistic effect of literacy types enhances stablecoin adoption accuracy.  
- Findings support targeted educational efforts to expand stablecoin use.  

## Abstract

We examine the adoption and continuance intentions of blockchain-based stablecoins for cross-border remittances. Relying on survey data from 866 U.S.-based adults engaged in remittance activities, our findings reveal that digital and financial literacy independently increase the likelihood of stablecoin adoption. Their interaction synergistically enhances predictive accuracy. 

Demographic analysis indicates that stablecoin remittance users tend to be younger, more educated, and involved in higher-value transactions. Among the 26% of remittance users who adopted stablecoins, continuance intentions are primarily driven by satisfaction and perceived usefulness. This points to a cyclical dynamic. Meeting user expectations leads to greater satisfaction, which in turn reinforces the perceived usefulness of stablecoins. 

The results underscore the importance of promoting both digital and financial literacy. Improving user experience and effectively communicating tangible benefits encourage the continued adoption of stablecoins for remittance transactions. Ultimately, these efforts could contribute to a more efficient and cost-effective remittance market. This aligns with the 10th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to reduce transaction costs of remittances to less than 3 percent by 2030.

## 1. Introduction

Remittances are pivotal in the global economy. They facilitate billions of dollars in cross-border transactions annually. They also serve as a lifeline for millions of families worldwide. However, with an estimated global average cost of 6.2 percent for sending remittances (World Bank, 2023), they arguably remain inefficient. This is especially concerning the 10th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). The goal is to reduce transaction costs of remittances to less than 3 percent. It also aims to eliminate corridors with costs higher than 5 percent by 2030 (UNDP, 2024). 

Amidst this backdrop, novel approaches have been introduced. These approaches pursue the goal of making remittances more efficient. They include mobile money such as M−Pesa (Osabutey and Jackson, 2024; Shaikh et al., 2023), online money transfer services such as Wise (Guermond, 2022), or blockchain-based stablecoins such as Tether’s USDT or Circle’s USDC (Ante et al., 2021a; Li and Shen, 2021). 

Stablecoins are digital currencies designed to maintain a stable value. They do this relative to reference assets such as the US Dollar (USD). Thus, they offer a non-volatile alternative to volatile cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (Berentsen and Schär, 2019; Catalini et al., 2022). Built on blockchain technology, stablecoins represent digital tokens. They are issued and managed via smart contracts, i.e., decentrally anchored computer code, on distributed ledgers (Ante, 2021). Each stablecoin transaction is recorded on the blockchain. This ensures an immutable and verifiable history of ownership and transfer. 

Depending on their design, stablecoins achieve price stability through various mechanisms. These include being backed by underlying reserves (e.g., USDT or USDC), pegged to a basket of assets, or using algorithmic methods to adjust supply dynamically (Fiedler and Ante, 2023). Over the past years, stablecoins have evolved from a niche product in the crypto asset sector. They have become an increasingly relevant aspect of financial markets. This can be illustrated by growth in market size and increased adoption by firms and households. 

For example, stablecoins that peg their value to the USD have grown into a $200 billion market (CoinGecko, 2024). This market is already regulated by specific legislation such as the EU’s European Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) (ESMA, 2024). From an adoption perspective, 28% of Nigerian internet-using adults and 12% of Argentinians reported owning stablecoins. This is likely as a means to store and transfer money in USD. At the same time, over half of the people surveyed in these countries were aware of stablecoins (Coinbase, 2023; Onu and Sgazzin, 2024). 

From a corporate perspective, established payment companies such as PayPal or Visa have initiated or launched stablecoin projects. This showcases the phenomenon’s growing relevance (PayPal, 2024; VISA, 2023).

The process of sending money across borders has traditionally been fraught with challenges. These challenges include high transaction fees, prolonged processing times, and limited access for unbanked populations (Kulkarni et al., 2019; Lopez et al., 2007; Rapoport and Docquier, 2006). 

These barriers impose financial strains on individuals reliant on remittances for their livelihood. They also hinder economic development in remittance-receiving countries (Mohamed, 2023; Rapoport and Docquier, 2006; Yang, 2011). In this context, stablecoins represent a promising alternative to conventional remittance solutions. 

By tethering their value to stable assets like fiat currencies, stablecoins mitigate the volatility typically associated with cryptocurrencies. This, along with the fact that they can be utilized just with a smartphone, makes them an attractive medium for secure and rapid cross-border transactions. They do not require a bank account. 

A potential shift towards digital currency-based remittances thus heralds a move toward financial inclusion. This shift could potentially democratize access to financial services for millions around the globe (Fiedler and Ante, 2023).

Despite the apparent potential of stablecoins, empirical research remains sparse. They could enhance the efficiency and accessibility of cross-border remittances. While anecdotal evidence (Coinbase, 2023) and academia (Ante et al., 2023; Kulkarni et al., 2019; Murakami and Viswanath-Natraj, 2021) suggest that stablecoins could be a tool for financial inclusion, a notable gap persists. 

This gap includes understanding a) stablecoin adoption for remittances in general and b) the specific factors that influence individuals' decisions to adopt these digital currencies for remittance purposes. Neither the existing literature on the adoption and utilization of crypto assets (e.g., Steinmetz et al., 2021; Weber et al., 2023) nor the literature on the adoption of payment solutions (e.g., Chen and Nath, 2008; Ullah et al., 2022) has analyzed the actual adoption of stablecoins. This constitutes a clear research gap.

Furthermore, the roles of digital and financial literacy in this adoption process are not documented. These factors have been identified as predictors of adopting new technology and payment systems in other contexts (e.g., Kosse and Vermeulen, 2014). 

The existing literature on stablecoins largely focuses on technical and financial aspects (Ante et al., 2021b; Bojaj et al., 2022; Grobys et al., 2021; Hoang and Baur, 2021; Kakinuma, 2023; Thanh et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020). This leaves a critical void regarding how individual capabilities and knowledge in digital and financial domains interact to influence stablecoin utilization. 

This gap underscores the need for empirical evidence. Such evidence should uncover the dynamics between digital skills, financial literacy, and the adoption of innovative financial technologies like stablecoins. Addressing this research gap is crucial for developing interventions. These interventions can support the potential adoption of stablecoins for remittances. They can maximize their potential for financial inclusion and improve global remittance flows.

This study relies on an empirical exploration of the adoption of stablecoins for cross-border remittances. It draws on survey data from 866 US-based adults who actively engaged in remittances over the past 12 months. 

The first objective is to quantify the extent of stablecoin adoption within this cohort. This will provide initial empirical evidence on the actual utilization of stablecoins for remittances. It will also assess the actual significance of stablecoins for the remittances market at the current time. 

Second, we dissect the role of digital and financial literacy in individuals' choice to utilize stablecoins for international money transfers. We aim to uncover patterns and correlations that clarify the role of digital and financial literacy in this emerging financial practice. We will also control for sociodemographic characteristics. 

Third, we extend our analysis to include the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) (Bhattacherjee, 2001). We investigate the continuation intentions of stablecoin users. This aspect of the study aims to understand the factors influencing whether individuals continue to use stablecoins after initially adopting them. We focus on perceived usefulness, confirmation, and satisfaction of initial expectations. 

This study’s approach seeks to map the current landscape of stablecoin use in US-based remittances. It also aims to understand the underlying factors that drive individuals toward embracing this digital financial innovation. Through this lens, we contribute to the broader dialogue on technology adoption, digital finance, and financial inclusion. We offer a better understanding of how technological proficiency and financial acumen intersect to facilitate the continued adoption of stablecoins.

Our analysis reveals that a subset of 26% of respondents reported using stablecoins for remittance purposes. This shows that stablecoins already represent a widely used alternative for cross-border remittances. This needs to be understood in more detail. 

We identify significant positive correlations between digital and financial literacy and the adoption of stablecoins for remittances. This corresponds to the direction of research results on similar topics, such as fintech (Hasan et al., 2021; Ullah et al., 2022). The relevance of digital literacy for stablecoin adoption is comparatively stronger than financial literacy. However, the two skills reinforce each other. This indicates a need for “digital financial literacy,” an emerging topic in academic research (Lyons and Kass-Hanna, 2021). 

For the continuation intentions, we identify a reinforcing nexus between confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction. The latter two explain 69.6% of the variance in continuance intention. The results imply a cyclical benefit. Meeting expectations satisfies users and makes stablecoins seem even more useful to them.

Our investigation contributes to research on financial inclusion (Kabakova and Plaksenkov, 2018; Sarma and Pais, 2011). It highlights how digital and financial literacy serve as fundamental levers for accessing innovative financial services. It also underscores the transformative potential of stablecoins in broadening financial inclusion. 

We contribute to consumer behavior research (Nelson, 1970). More specifically, we enhance the understanding of consumer decision-making processes underlying the uptake of financial technology and payment solutions (Hasan et al., 2021; Mallat, 2007; Singh et al., 2020). We uncover the relevance of digital and financial literacy on consumer preferences towards the utilization of stablecoins for remittances. 

Additionally, our findings speak directly to the concept of the digital divide. This refers to the gap between individuals based on their access to forms of information and communication technology (Lythreatis et al., 2022; van Dijk and Hacker, 2003). The significant correlation between digital and financial literacy and the utilization of stablecoins suggests that educational initiatives could be used to mitigate this divide.

Our findings on continuation intention contribute to research on the application of the ECM. This is in the context of digital financial services (Bhattacherjee, 2001; Franque et al., 2022, 2021). Both confirmation of initial expectations and perceived utility of the technology strongly predict continued usage. 

Our results suggest that enhancing user perceptions of the benefits of stablecoins could directly influence their long-term adoption for remittances. This provides a pathway for increasing financial inclusion through sustained technological engagement. 

This can contribute to developing educational programs and policy frameworks. These initiatives can promote the understanding and trust in stablecoins, particularly in underserved markets.

The findings from this study can inform policy-making and regulatory frameworks. Stablecoin legislation has either been recently introduced or is in the works (ESMA, 2024; Hamilton, 2024). Insights into the adoption patterns and influencing factors of stablecoins can guide the development of policies. These policies can support financial inclusion, safeguard consumer interests, and pave the way for an efficient digital financial ecosystem. 

Practically, the results offer valuable implications for financial education. By identifying the roles of digital skills and financial literacy in adopting stablecoins, educators can tailor their programs. This will better prepare individuals for the digital financial future. This could lead to more effective educational initiatives that empower consumers’ digital currency usage. 

Finally, the study’s insights can provide fintech ventures and other stakeholders with an understanding of their user base. They can also identify the factors that encourage stablecoin use. This can contribute to designing more user-friendly and accessible financial technologies. It can accelerate the adoption of stablecoins and other digital financial innovations. Ultimately, this will drive progress toward more inclusive financial services.

## 2. Theoretical background and hypotheses

### 2.1. Stablecoin adoption and utilization

Stablecoins represent a unique class of crypto assets. They are designed to offer stable values in relation to one or more reference assets (Grobys et al., 2021; Hoang and Baur, 2021). Unlike traditional cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, stablecoins aim to maintain a constant value over time. 

Traditional cryptocurrencies can experience significant price fluctuations in short periods (Chaim and Laurini, 2018). This stability is typically achieved by pegging the stablecoin's value to a stable asset or basket of assets. These assets can include fiat currencies (e.g., USD) or commodities (e.g., gold). 

The primary purpose of stablecoins pegged to USD is to combine features of crypto assets and blockchain transactions. They also incorporate the stable valuations and perceived trust of fiat currency. This makes them particularly appealing for various financial transactions, including cross-border remittances. In these cases, volatility can add an unwanted layer of risk. 

By offering a digital currency alternative that is both stable and efficient, stablecoins aim to address some key limitations. These limitations include those of traditional banking systems (e.g., transaction costs, processing times, or access limitations) and cryptocurrencies (e.g., volatility or legal uncertainty). Stablecoins position themselves as a viable tool for global money transfers in the digital age.

The intrinsic stability of stablecoins, combined with the operational advantages of blockchain technology, positions stablecoins as a formidable solution. They address the challenges traditionally associated with international money transfers. 

Key among the advantages of stablecoins is their potential to reduce transaction fees drastically. In a Kenyan pilot study (Mercy Corps, 2022), stablecoins were employed for micropayments. This showed notable benefits, including lower transaction fees, increased earnings, and promoted savings among youths. 

Transaction fees for cross-border micropayments equivalent to $5.00 through stablecoins were reduced to 2.02 percent ($0.10). This contrasts sharply with traditional systems like PayPal, which charged up to 28.8 percent ($1.44) for similar transactions. This reduction in fees for the same transaction value significantly lowered operational costs for digital microwork. It allowed workers to keep more of their earnings and bolstered the financial efficacy of digital labor (Mercy Corps, 2022). 

The pilot study illustrates how traditional payment methods involve a complex web of intermediaries. Each intermediary adds layers of costs that can cumulatively impose significant financial burdens on users. Stablecoins, by leveraging the decentralized nature of blockchain transactions, circumvent the need for these intermediaries. They offer a more cost-effective channel for sending money (Ante et al., 2021a; Berentsen and Schär, 2019).

Furthermore, the processing speed of stablecoin transactions can represent an improvement over conventional remittance methods. Traditional cross-border payments are often bogged down by procedural and operational constraints of banking systems. These payments can sometimes take days to complete (Nilsson et al., 2022). In contrast, stablecoin transactions can be executed close to real-time (BIS, 2023). 

This expedited processing ensures that recipients gain access to funds more swiftly. This is an advantage when time-sensitive financial support is needed. Another benefit of stablecoins is their ability to extend financial services to unbanked and underbanked populations. They are accessible via smartphone technology and, therefore, require minimal entry criteria. 

Similar to mobile payments like M-Pesa (Mallat, 2007), this democratizes access to financial services. It enhances financial inclusion (Catalini et al., 2022; Kulkarni et al., 2019; Pal et al., 2021). In synthesizing these attributes—lower transaction fees, faster processing times, and increased accessibility—stablecoins emerge as a promising alternative to traditional remittance methods.

Despite their advantages, stablecoins also encounter hurdles in global remittance adoption. Regulatory and organizational uncertainty impedes their broader utilization. The necessity for reliable internet access complicates their usage. Challenges posed by blockchain platforms—such as the irreversibility and transparency of transactions—further complicate broader adoption. 

Additionally, the effectiveness of stablecoins in remittances is contingent upon the availability and efficiency of on- and off-ramps. These ramps facilitate the conversion between stablecoins and local currencies. This is especially important as long as stablecoins do not represent a broadly accepted means of payment in a region. Inconsistencies in their accessibility can significantly impact the practicality and appeal of stablecoins for cross-border transactions (BIS, 2023).

Building on the outlined potentials of stablecoins, we propose that a proportion of individuals engaging in remittances will report having used stablecoins for this purpose. 

We ask the research question (RQ): 

RQ: What is the prevalence of stablecoin use among remittance users?

### 2.2. Digital literacy

Digital literacy refers to skills and knowledge that enable individuals to use digital technologies effectively. These competencies encompass a broad range of abilities. Basic digital literacy includes the ability to use digital devices for communication and information retrieval. More advanced skills include data analysis, online security practices, and understanding digital financial services (Oberländer et al., 2020). 

In the context of the digital economy, digital skills facilitate day-to-day activities. They also empower individuals to participate fully in the digital world, including the financial sector (van Deursen and van Dijk, 2009). This is particularly relevant as financial technologies evolve. They offer new ways to manage and invest money, access loans, and execute transactions. 

The ability to effectively interact with digital (financial) services can lead to improved academic achievements (Pagani et al., 2016), job opportunities (Periáñez-Cañadillas et al., 2019), access to financial opportunities (Lo Prete, 2022), and overall economic well-being (Choung et al., 2023). 

Moreover, as the financial sector increasingly incorporates digital technologies, the importance of digital literacy has never been more pronounced. For individuals, the ability to understand and utilize digital technologies can lead to more efficient and secure financial transactions (Maji and Laha, 2023). It can also promote greater financial inclusion (Kass-Hanna et al., 2022; Okello Candiya Bongomin et al., 2024) and better financial decision-making (Kumar et al., 2023). 

For economies, enhancing the digital literacy of the populace can drive financial literacy (Lo Prete, 2022) and economic growth (Morandini et al., 2020). This makes digital skills development a priority for policymakers and educators alike.

Existing research highlights a strong link between digital literacy and the adoption of financial technologies. Individuals with higher digital skills are more likely to embrace and effectively use them (Maji and Laha, 2023; Ullah et al., 2022). This relationship is underpinned by several key factors that align closely with the adoption of stablecoins. 

First, digital literacy enhances an individual’s confidence and ability to engage with digital platforms. This makes it more likely for them to explore and adopt new financial technologies. Studies have shown that familiarity with digital interfaces and confidence in using digital tools increase the likelihood of adopting fintech products (Hasan et al., 2021; Nangin et al., 2020). This correlation is particularly relevant to stablecoins. Individuals with a solid understanding of digital security, transaction verification, and digital wallet management are better positioned to appreciate the benefits and challenges of stablecoins. 

Second, the cognitive aspect of digital literacy plays a crucial role in participation in fintech markets. Understanding and analyzing information related to digital financial services enables individuals to make informed decisions. It also helps them assess risks and recognize the advantages of innovative services (Grennan and Michaely, 2021; Königsheim et al., 2017). 

For instance, understanding stablecoin design choices (Briola et al., 2022; Moin et al., 2020), the mechanisms that ensure the stability of stablecoins (Hoang and Baur, 2021), and how they can be used for remittances or as a hedge against currency volatility (Kakinuma, 2023) requires a level of digital (financial) literacy that goes beyond basic digital skills.

Finally, the digital divide—differences in access to and proficiency with digital technologies—emerges as a significant factor in fintech adoption (Lythreatis et al., 2022; van Dijk and Hacker, 2003). Bridging this divide by improving digital literacy can increase financial inclusion, especially among underbanked populations (Odei-Appiah et al., 2022; van Deursen and van Dijk, 2011). 

Stablecoins could potentially offer substantial benefits to these groups. However, the effective utilization of stablecoins for financial transactions and remittances may depend on overcoming barriers related to digital skills. 

In summary, the existing body of research underscores the importance of digital literacy. It fosters the adoption and effective use of fintech and, thus, stablecoins. Therefore, we hypothesize: 

H1: Higher digital literacy is positively associated with using stablecoins for remittances.

### 2.3. Financial literacy

Financial literacy encompasses the knowledge and understanding of financial concepts and products. It enables individuals to make informed and effective decisions with their financial resources. This includes understanding the basics of budgeting, investing, saving, and complex financial products and markets (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011). 

Financial literacy is pivotal in effective decision-making (Mandell and Klein, 2009; van Rooij et al., 2011) and in adopting new financial products (Ullah et al., 2022). Individuals with a higher degree of financial literacy are better equipped to evaluate the risks and benefits of fintech. They can make investment choices and avoid financial pitfalls (Cox et al., 2015; Jünger and Mietzner, 2020; Korkmaz et al., 2021). 

As a key enabler in adopting new financial products (Long et al., 2023), financial literacy aids consumers. It helps them recognize the utility and potential of emerging fintech services. It also helps them understand the mechanisms underpinning these solutions. For example, a basic understanding of digital currencies and blockchain technology can significantly influence an individual’s willingness and ability to adopt such technologies for financial transactions (Al-Omoush et al., 2024). 

In the realm of stablecoins and other fintech innovations, financial literacy facilitates a deeper understanding of the advantages and potential risks associated with these instruments. This leads to more confident and strategic financial behaviors. Thus, enhancing financial literacy is paramount for fostering the adoption and responsible use of innovative financial products (Jünger and Mietzner, 2020; Long et al., 2023). It contributes to greater financial inclusion and the overall resilience of individuals in the face of financial challenges.

Studies examining the impact of financial literacy on the adoption and utilization of financial innovations underscore a critical trend. As financial literacy increases, so does the likelihood of adopting new financial technologies (Lo Prete, 2022). 

This leads us to hypothesize: 

H2: Higher financial literacy is positively associated with using stablecoins for remittances.

### 2.4. Interrelation of digital and financial literacy

Digital and financial literacy are positively associated (Lo Prete, 2022). While each factor individually plays a significant role in adopting and utilizing new fintech products (Koskelainen et al., 2023), their interrelation suggests a compounded effect. This effect could further influence user behavior towards stablecoins, particularly in the remittance sector. 

Digital literacy provides the technical foundation for individuals to utilize digital financial platforms effectively. Financial literacy, on the other hand, offers knowledge and understanding about financial products and investments. This includes the risks and benefits associated with them. When these two factors converge, they create a potent combination. This combination could significantly enhance an individual’s capacity to adopt and optimally use financial innovations like stablecoins. In fact, academic research is already working on conceptualizing “digital financial literacy” (Lyons and Kass-Hanna, 2021). 

The synergistic effect of high digital and financial literacy may be particularly relevant in the context of stablecoins. Individuals proficient in digital skills are more adept at using digital platforms. They also understand the technical aspects of stablecoins, such as their reliance on blockchain technology. Concurrently, financial literacy empowers these individuals to assess the potential economic advantages of using stablecoins. These advantages include cost savings or faster transaction speeds against potential risks. 

This combined effect suggests that the likelihood of adopting stablecoins for remittances may be significantly higher among individuals with high digital and financial literacy. Therefore, the following hypothesis is formulated: 

H3: The interaction between digital and financial literacy enhances the prediction of stablecoin adoption for remittances beyond the individual contributions of digital literacy and financial literacy.

### Continuation intention

Continuation intention refers to an individual’s decision to use a (financial) technology after its initial adoption. The study of continuation intention originates from the broader field of technology acceptance and information systems (Davis, 1989; Venkatesh and Xu, 2012). It is particularly influenced by the ECM of information systems continuance (Bhattacherjee, 2001), which we also rely on in this study. The ECM suggests that users’ continuation intentions are influenced by their post-adoption expectations, subsequent confirmation of these expectations, perceived usefulness of the technology, and overall satisfaction (Bhattacherjee, 2001). The model has been widely applied to studying user retention and loyalty in digital markets (Lee, 2010; Thong et al., 2006) and financial technology (Franque et al., 2022; Franque et al., 2021).

Central to the ECM, satisfaction is posited as a mediator between confirmation (i.e., whether the technology meets or exceeds initial expectations) and continuation intention. This relationship is grounded in the argument that satisfied consumers are more likely to repeat a purchase or continue using a service (Oliver, 1980). Another predictor of continuation intention is the perceived usefulness of a technology after initial adoption. This usefulness can be enhanced by the confirmation of expectations (Prakash, 1984). If users find stablecoins beneficial for their remittance needs—such as reducing transaction costs and time—they are more likely to perceive them as useful and will continue using them. 

Finally, confirmation occurs when initial expectations about technology are met or exceeded (Brown et al., 2008). In the case of stablecoins, users may have expectations related to transaction speed, cost, usability, and price stability. The degree to which these expectations are confirmed directly influences user satisfaction and perceived usefulness. This, in turn, indirectly affects their continuation intentions.

By relying on the ECM and its five (slightly adjusted) hypotheses, we utilize a model that has been verified for the adoption of financial technology (Bhattacherjee, 2001) and should thus also hold in this study. Fig. 1 visualizes the conceptual models, the five hypotheses, and their proposed association.

![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0736585324001345-gr1.jpg)

Fig. 1. Conceptual model of continuation intention in stablecoin use. Adapted from Bhattacherjee (2001). This model illustrates the relationships among key constructs in the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM). Specifically, the figure shows how confirmation influences perceived usefulness and satisfaction (H5 and H8, respectively). Perceived usefulness also directly affects satisfaction (H6). Both satisfaction (H4) and perceived usefulness (H7) are direct antecedents of continuance intention. The model highlights the role of user perceptions and prior experiences in determining the continued use of stablecoins for remittances.

The first hypothesis of the ECM is grounded in the principle that positive experiences foster the repeat behavior of consumers (e.g., Kahneman and Tversky, 1979). Satisfaction is a comprehensive assessment of users’ emotional state after meeting their expectations about stablecoins. In the context of stablecoins, satisfaction refers to the positive experiences users gain from using stablecoins for remittances. This includes achieving faster transaction times, lower fees, or improved security over traditional remittance methods. If initial experiences are positive, users are more likely to develop a favorable attitude towards using a product like stablecoins again (Lee and Kwon, 2011; Limayem and Cheung, 2008).

In financial contexts, satisfaction plays an even more critical role due to the inherently trust-based nature of financial services (Franque et al., 2022). Thus, we expect that users who are satisfied with the performance and experience of using stablecoins for remittances will exhibit stronger continuance intentions. These users will feel more confident and emotionally aligned with the benefits of the technology.

H4: Users' level of satisfaction with initial stablecoin use is positively associated with their stablecoin continuance intentions.

Hypothesis 5 posits that the extent of confirmation—the degree to which initial expectations are met or exceeded—affects user satisfaction. This follows from the ECM’s emphasis on the role of confirmation in fostering satisfaction (Bhattacherjee, 2001). When users’ anticipations about a product or service are confirmed, satisfaction will likely increase (Yan et al., 2021). Applied to stablecoins for remittances, confirmation refers to the degree to which the technology meets the anticipated benefits. These benefits include lower transaction fees and faster processing, relative to traditional options.

When stablecoin users experience confirmation of their expectations, they are likely to feel more satisfied because the technology delivers as promised. Conversely, if stablecoins fail to meet these expectations, dissatisfaction is likely to result. This would diminish users’ continuance intentions. In the context of financial technologies, where reliability and cost-effectiveness are paramount, confirmation acts as a necessary precursor to user satisfaction.

H5: Users' extent of confirmation is positively associated with their satisfaction with stablecoin use.

Perceived usefulness represents one of the central constructs of the technology acceptance model (TAM). It is defined as the degree to which a user believes that using a particular technology will enhance their task performance (Davis, 1989). As a core element of TAM, perceived usefulness reflects the functional value that users associate with technology. It directly influences their behavioral intentions to adopt and continue using it. 

Within the ECM, perceived usefulness operates as both a direct antecedent of satisfaction and an indirect predictor of continuance intention (Bhattacherjee, 2001). In the context of stablecoins, perceived usefulness captures users' belief that these digital assets provide significant benefits. These benefits include efficiency and cost-effectiveness in remittance transactions. 

The following hypothesis is based on the premise that the more beneficial users find stablecoins, the higher their overall satisfaction with the financial technology. This perceived usefulness is often enhanced when a service reliably meets transactional and financial security needs. This fosters a sense of dependability and value among users and promotes satisfaction (Lin and Lu, 2011).

H6: Users' perceived usefulness of stablecoin use is positively associated with their satisfaction with stablecoin use.

We hypothesize that perceived usefulness not only influences satisfaction but also directly impacts continuation intention. The TAM suggests that the more useful a technology is, the more likely users are to continue its use. In the context of stablecoins, perceived usefulness refers to the degree to which users find stablecoins beneficial for their remittance needs. This could involve advantages such as lower fees, reduced transaction times, or increased security. These factors are particularly relevant in remittance markets where efficiency and reliability are critical.

Perceived usefulness will be especially important in encouraging long-term use of stablecoins, which are still relatively novel in the remittance market. If users consistently perceive stablecoins as providing tangible benefits, they are more likely to continue using them. The technology’s practical utility outweighs the costs or learning curve associated with adoption.

H7: Users' stablecoin continuance intention is positively associated with their perceived usefulness of stablecoin use.

Finally, hypothesis 8 highlights that confirming users’ initial expectations enhances their perceived usefulness. This can lead to the decision to continue using stablecoins for remittances. When expectations are met, users typically perceive the service as reliable and advantageous. This increases the likelihood of sustained use (Bhattacherjee, 2001; Yan et al., 2021).

For stablecoins, confirmation might involve users finding that the technology provides the promised benefits. Once these expectations are confirmed, users are more likely to perceive stablecoins as useful for their ongoing remittance activities. Thus, we hypothesize that confirmation will positively influence users’ perceived usefulness of stablecoins, thereby supporting their continuance intention.

H8: Users' extent of confirmation is positively associated with their perceived usefulness of stablecoins.

## 3. Data and descriptive statistics

### 3.1. Data collection

Our sample comprises 866 adults residing in the United States. These individuals met the eligibility criteria for engaging in cross-border remittance activities within the last year. Participants completed an online survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The survey assessed their use of different methods to send remittances, the frequency of sending money to their home country, and the value of money sent per remittance transaction. Further digital competencies, financial literacy, ECM model constructs, and demographic information were also surveyed.

Using MTurk for participant recruitment provided an efficient method to access a broad and diverse participant pool (Aguinis et al., 2021). This is particularly advantageous for a study exploring emerging trends in financial technology usage. However, potential limitations associated with using MTurk for data collection include topics such as inattention (Barends and de Vries, 2019; Buchanan and Scofield, 2018), self-selection bias (Cheung et al., 2017; Clifford and Jerit, 2014), self-misrepresentation (Necka et al., 2016; Sharpe Wessling et al., 2017), and the understanding of survey questions (Goodman et al., 2013). To mitigate these concerns, we implemented most of Aguinis et al.’s (2021) recommendations for addressing validity threats in research using MTurk. Further, MTurk populations may be skewed regarding age, education, and financial and digital literacy compared to the general population (Huff and Tingley, 2015).

The survey only targeted MTurk workers located in the United States who met MTurk's Masters Qualification. This qualification is assigned by MTurk to identify high-performing and reliable workers based on their history. Respondents were financially compensated to complete the survey—at a slightly higher rate than the minimum wage in the U.S. A pilot sample of 10 individuals tested the survey in early 2024. The actual data collection occurred from March 10th to April 1st, 2024. On average, respondents required 14 minutes to complete the survey. Out of the 934 MTurk workers who responded to the survey, 68 were removed from the dataset due to failing attention checks and problems with data quality.

## 3.2. Measures

Respondents were asked what main methods they typically utilized for remittances. They were able to choose multiple options, including but not limited to traditional bank transfers, online money transfer services (e.g., PayPal, Revolut), money transfer services (e.g., Western Union, MoneyGram), mobile money (e.g., M-Pesa, Airtel Money), stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC), or others. Further, they were asked to indicate how much money they usually sent per transaction (volume). They could choose from a set of predefined intervals: (1) under $100, (2) $100 − $250, (3) $251 − $500, (4) $501 − $750, (5) $751 − $1,000, (6) $1,001 − $2,000, (7) $2,000 − $5,000, or (8) more than $5,000. Finally, we asked how frequently individuals sent money to their home country. The answer options were: (1) monthly, (2) every 2–3 months, (3) semi-annually, (4) annually, and (5) less than once a year.

Digital literacy. To assess participants' general digital competencies, we adapted the six-dimensional scale from Rubach and Lazarides (2021). This scale includes questions regarding (1) information and data literacy, (2) communication and collaboration, (3) digital content creation, (4) safety and security, (5) problem-solving, and (6) analyzing and reflecting. Thus, digital literacy was determined based on self-assessment, representing a common measurement approach (Oberländer et al., 2020). 

Four to six items per dimension were rated on a Likert scale. The scale ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) and was validated using confirmatory factor analysis. In line with Becker et al.’s (2012) recommendations for hierarchical latent variable models, digital literacy was modeled as a g-factor model. This model included three s-order and nine first-order factors using mean values. Table A.1 presents all dimensions and questions, as well as standardized factor loadings along with estimates for reliability and validity associated with various multi-item scales. The composite reliability (CR) for the perceived digital literacy scale was 0.93.

Financial literacy. We relied on the “big three” questions following Lusardi and Mitchell (2011) to measure the respondents’ levels of financial literacy. This set of questions served as a foundational tool for gauging an individual’s financial literacy. It focuses on concepts of interest rates, inflation, and risk diversification. The questions are specifically designed to test basic financial knowledge. They also assess the ability to apply such knowledge in decision-making processes related to personal finance. The effectiveness of these questions lies in their simplicity and strong correlation with financial behaviors and outcomes (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011). 

Firstly, the question on interest rates assesses a respondent’s understanding of how interest accumulates over time. This understanding is crucial for making decisions about savings, loans, and investments. The second question, concerning inflation, tests an individual’s grasp of the changing value of money and its purchasing power. This concept affects long-term financial planning and the real value of savings. Lastly, the question on risk diversification evaluates a respondent's knowledge of the principle that spreading investments across various assets can reduce risk. This is an essential strategy for protecting and growing wealth (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011). 

Participants receive a score of one for each correctly answered question and a score of zero for incorrect answers. The cumulative score represents the participant's financial literacy level, where a higher score signifies greater financial knowledge. The breakdown of responses to each financial knowledge question and the corresponding levels of financial literacy are detailed in Table A.2.

Continuation intentions. To test the continuation intentions of individuals who adopted stablecoins for cross-border remittances, we relied on the ECM (Bhattacherjee, 2001) using structural equation modeling (SEM). This framework enables the examination of user satisfaction and subsequent continuance intentions based on initial expectations and their subsequent confirmation. 

The constructs of the model are: (1) perceived usefulness (PU), which assesses the user's belief in the utility of stablecoins in enhancing the management of cross-border remittances; (2) confirmation (C), measuring whether the user's initial expectations about stablecoins were met; (3) user satisfaction (S); and (4) continuation intention (CI), capturing user intentions regarding the continued use of stablecoins. 

All constructs, their items, and factor loadings are presented in Table A.3 in the appendix. These were measured using seven-point Likert scales. We utilized confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to confirm the validity of the constructs and evaluated convergent validity, as suggested by Fornell and Larcker (1981).

Control variables. Following the methodological advice to incorporate conceptually relevant and statistically significant controls (Becker et al., 2016), we included five control variables at the individual level. This was done to consider potential alternative explanations for the observed variations in our outcome measures. 

We categorized respondents’ age groups as a categorical control variable. This acknowledges prior findings that highlight age’s significance in the adoption and utilization of (financial) technologies in general (Morris and Venkatesh, 2000; Riskinanto et al., 2017) and crypto assets in particular (Steinmetz et al., 2021). The variable’s categories are: (1) 18 to 24; (2) 25 to 34; (3) 35 to 44; (4) 45 to 54; (5) 55 to 64; (6) 65 and over. 

Additionally, we accounted for the influence of gender (dummy variable; (1) female, (0) male) on technology and crypto asset adoption. This is in line with recent studies (Ante et al., 2023; Bannier et al., 2019). Furthermore, we adjusted our models for educational attainment and net income levels (Steinmetz et al., 2021), relying on ordinal scales to categorize the variables. 

The categorical education variable stands for the highest level of education obtained: (1) no schooling; (2) high school, trade, technical, vocational training, apprenticeship; (3) Bachelor’s degree; (4) Master’s degree; (5) Doctorate. Income represents average monthly net income categories: (1) less than $500; (2) $500 to $999; (3) $1,000 to $1,499; (4) $1,500 to $1,999; (5) $2,000 to $2,999; (6) $3,000 to $4,999; (7) more than $5,000. 

Lastly, respondents' employment status was factored in through dummy coding. This included job-seeking, student, self-employed, employed, and retired. We recognized its established correlation with crypto asset adoption in prior research (Fujiki, 2020).

### 3.3. Sample description

A share of 26% of the respondents reported that they utilized stablecoins for cross-border remittances over the past 12 months. However, 33.9% of them also reported using other methods. Summary statistics and group comparisons are shown in Table 1. 

With a score of 2.95 for frequency, individuals have sent remittances at semi-annual intervals, on average. Regarding value or volume, the average score of 3.31 indicates an average remittance worth between $251 to $500 (every 6 months). When comparing stablecoin users with non-users, the frequency of remittances was quite similar.

Stablecoin users transacted significantly larger volumes. However, on average, both groups remained in the category of $251 to $500. The analysis of digital and financial literacy showed that the group of stablecoin users had considerably higher average scores for both measures. 

Considering that the scale for digital literacy ranges from 1 to 5 and for financial literacy from 0 to 3, the statistically significant group differences of 0.52 for digital literacy and 0.37 for financial literacy represent considerable gaps. These gaps can be interpreted as an indication of the digital divide. 

Fig. 2 visualizes the differences in the distribution of digital and financial literacy scores among stablecoin users and non-users using violin plots. Especially for digital literacy, the differences are intuitively visually apparent.
