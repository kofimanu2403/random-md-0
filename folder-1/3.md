Improve paragraphing and punctuation only. Don't mess up the words beyond basic spelling corrections. I like meaty / chunky paragraphs. Don't skimp on markdown formatting:

# JavaScript

JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language that supports object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g., functional programming) styles.

JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via `eval`), object introspection (via `for...in` and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through `toString()`).

This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself and not the parts that are specific to web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.
