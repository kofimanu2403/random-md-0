# Coursework 2A - Design and Build a Clickable Prototype

## INTRODUCTION
In this coursework, you will continue using a User-Centered Design (UCD) approach. This approach develops your prototype application from Coursework 1. This coursework focuses on the next design phase: a medium fidelity prototype.

### About this Project
This is a substantial project. It provides participants the opportunity to develop and enhance diverse skills. The final prototype will be added to student portfolios. It should be suitable for interviews with potential employers. This project has many diverse deliverables and is team-based.

This project involves designing, building, and evaluating a medium fidelity, clickable prototype app. It logically extends Coursework 1. The project will be driven by the research, analysis, and requirements engineering activities from Coursework 1. The tasks for this coursework are summarized as follows:

1. Review feedback from Coursework 1 and implement improvements.
2. Design and build a prototype app using prototyping tools.
3. Conduct evaluations of your app.
4. Critically appraise the app and make redesign recommendations.

#### Prototyping Tools
Students can use a preferred tool to create the prototype. The default tool is the Adobe XD suite. Students may also use any other appropriate prototyping tool. It is advised that students select a tool they are confident in using. The responsibility for learning these tools lies with the student. If you use an alternative tool, consider Data Protection – GDPR.

## YOUR TEAM
You will continue working in the team established during Coursework 1. Each team will consist of 4-5 members from the same workshop group. Workshops provide opportunities for teams to work on relevant subject matters. It is not permissible to form a team across different workshop groups. 

If you are unhappy with your original team, you may join a different team of your choice, provided that:

- Your team has no more than five members, including yourself.
- The members of the team you are joining agree to have you.
- You inform your workshop leader by the third workshop week of the teaching block.

Since you can change your team until week 3, we expect your team to work well together afterward. If you still experience team problems (e.g., some members contribute very little), report this to your module leader immediately. We can then intervene and help resolve your team issues in a timely manner. No action can be taken if you inform us after this coursework has been submitted.

## EVIDENCE OF YOUR TEAM ENGAGEMENT
As part of this project, you must document time spent in meetings and on developing artifacts for each piece of coursework. You need to show this in an ePortfolio (located in Canvas) on a week-by-week basis. This allows for collaboration and teamwork contributions to be validated. If there are disputes over contributions, these documents, along with workshop staff and team members’ testimonies, will be used.

At the end of the teaching year, an individual’s final group coursework mark may be adjusted based on their contributions to teamwork.

If contributions are not equal among members:

- Member(s) with the highest contribution receive the full mark (no extra).
- Member(s) with low contributions (relative to the standard) receive a deduction. If there are five members, the standard contribution is 20%. 

For example, assume the standard contribution is 20% and the final mark is 85. A member with a 15% contribution has contributed 75% of their expected amount. Therefore, they will receive 85 * (15/20) = 63.75.

## COURSEWORK 2A REQUIREMENTS, DEADLINES, WEIGHTING, FEEDBACK

### Coursework 2A Template Documents
Your Coursework 2A assignment must be submitted on the appropriate team report template. This template can be found on Canvas under the Coursework 2A assignment link. It is your responsibility to ensure your full name and K-number are on the cover page. Marks will be awarded only to students whose names are on the cover page and on your workshop leader’s team list.

### Submission
This coursework must be submitted as ONE submission per TEAM, not one submission for each member. To submit as a team, you must join a Group in Canvas. This allows one submission to be allocated to all team members. The submission with the latest timestamp will be marked, provided it does not exceed the deadline.

### Deadlines and Mitigating Circumstances
You must meet all deadlines. Failure to do so will result in a penalty. Deadlines for module assessments are given in Table 1. Work submitted late but within 24 hours of the original deadline will receive full marks. Work submitted within five university working days of the original deadline will be capped at 40% and receive a grade of LP (Late Pass). If it is not of passing standard, it will receive a grade of LF (Late Fail). Work submitted beyond a week of the original deadline without approval will receive 0% and a grade of F0. For retakes, late work receives no marks.

If you are ill or have problems preventing you from meeting the deadline, you may negotiate an extension in advance. The University Mitigating Circumstances policy may apply. You will need to apply through osis.kingston.ac.uk. If you submit work or attend an examination, you have judged yourself fit to undertake the assessment and cannot claim mitigating circumstances retrospectively.

**Project Deliverables**  
| Where   | Deadline                     | Weighting |
|---------|------------------------------|-----------|
| Coursework 2A | Canvas | TB2 – 31/03/25; 11:59 PM | 40% |

**Table 1: Coursework 2A Deadline Details**  

Coursework 2A – TB2 captures activity from stage 3 of the Software Development Life Cycle for your project. It also reflects critical analysis in the form of heuristic evaluations.  
Stage 3: visual design, clickable prototype.

## COURSEWORK FEEDBACK
Coursework marks and feedback comments will be available via Canvas within three weeks from the respective submission deadline (excluding holidays).

## PLAGIARISM
Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as your own. It is an offense to copy materials (even a phrase or sentence) from the Internet or other publications. You must write everything in your own words. There is a heavy penalty for plagiarism, which could result in a ZERO mark and affect your academic record. Further information can be found at:
